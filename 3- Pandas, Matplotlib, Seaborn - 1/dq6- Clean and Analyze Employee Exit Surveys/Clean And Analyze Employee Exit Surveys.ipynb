    "- Established Employees (11years+ experience), rated at roughly 60% were the highest in Dissatisfaction, followed by Veterans (with 7-11 years of experience) who scored almost 55%.\n",
    "- Experienced Employees, the ones with 3-6 years of span had comparatively low rates of dissatisfaction, around 40%\n",
    "- Whereas the new employers, who are not done with even 3 years experience yet, look most satisfied as compared to other categories. The rate of their dissatisfaction is around 30%\n",
    "#### Conclusive Remarks\n",
    "- We can conclude that there is indeed a strong correlation between the Dissatisfaction levels and the years of service of an employee. "
